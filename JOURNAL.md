### Schematic Making Time!
I was going through instrutables and I was looking for some cool projects related to CAD, as that is what I do a lot these days, and I stumbled across something called the Space Mouse. What this mouse does is it allows you to maintain greater control in your CAD space as there is usually a lot of buttons and stuff. This simplifies it to just a 3-axis wheel. After seeing this, I decided that I wanted to build it myself. The only problem I had was that if I only built the 3-axis wheel, I would mostly just be copying the tutorial and not actually making a PCB or anything. To combat this, I decided that I wanted to build the "more expensive space mouse" from scratch which also includes buttons for hotkeys, and a small screen for some quick actions. This will allow me to follow the tutorial on what parts to buy for the 3-axis part, while still allowing me to build the PCB for keyboard + screen aspect. On top of this, I hope to build all the CAD from scratch too and not using the tutorial's CAD for it. This is because I need it to be one piece for the keyboard + screen part too. So far, what I have done is build the schematic for the keys + a few LEDs to allow for some sick ambient lighting. I did a little bit of research and found that I wanted to use the bigger Xiao chip as it has more IO to allow me to add the right amount of keys + the LEDs + the screen. Even though this chip does have BL built it, it's not my goal to use it.

### Routed the PCB
I know I haven't made a journal for sometime mostly because I forgot and now that the deadline is coming, I kinda need to ship it lol. I've finished designing the PCB which including making the cool shape that will fit perfectly in my case and wrap around the space mouse. In the end, I decided to add 10 buttons and a few LED's to add lots of hotkeys for the space mouse's CAD. This was the model that was over $300USD, and I can make it perfectly for $200 less which is amazing! What took me the most amount of time was definitely trying to make this abomination of the shape that the PCB is in. KiCad doesn't make it too easy to do these shapes sadly. Once I got the shape done, I just figured out were I wanted the buttons based on how the space mouse online looks like which didn't take too long.

Also, while writing this journal, I looked over the PCB and found a few spacing DRC errors and fixed those while I was at it.

### Making the CAD!
Writing my next journal right after the last one since #1, I was given permission to do it, and #2, I kinda forgot to write one for like a week so I should probably write one. I've been practicing using onshape for the past few months now, so I'm starting to get the hang of it, and it's becoming a lot easier, and more fun for me to make stuff with it! I used to make a simple square case, and now I have just made a complicated case to replicate the space mouse design for the keyboard aspect of it. I forgot to write this in my last journal, but I ended up not including the screen, as if I was going too, I would need a fairly large one, and that would cost way too much money. So I decided to add more keys over a screen in the end. I know it may look quite complicated, but at it's core, it's not too complicated. It's just a sketch that I extruded up, and then another sketch going across to cut into it to create this shape. Hopefully this case will print well since it has a lot of curves, but with a little bit of sanding, it's going to look sick!
